# An Argument Website

I have an idea for a website/game based on quickly finding people to argue with. Other websites of this type exist, but they mostly suck (<a href="http://arg.umentum.com/">http://arg.umentum.com/</a>) or are focused on the spectatorship of long and well thought out debates (<a href="http://www.debate.org/">http://www.debate.org/</a>).

I want a site where participation is easy and doesn't require a big commitment of time or effort. Ideally you could just drop-in and have a quick argument whenever you felt like it.

To encourage short discussions over long debates, I propose having the debaters decide on a time limit and character limit for their responses. The debate would then be very much like a game, a race against the clock to understand and refute your opponent's arguments.

This debate site could help people practice arguing for or against their favorite propositions, and help connect people together who just want to practice their debating, reading-comprehension, or even typing skills.

My ulterior motive behind this idea is that if such a site existed, I would encourage people to argue **against** their favorite ideologies. This is the best way I can think of to really understand the opposing viewpoint, and one of the only ways I know of to actually change your mind.

As an example, see if you can argue why this website is a bad idea in the remaining time!

On second thought, it would probably be better not to have any gimmicky time limits and to just setup an IRC-like private chat.

                content_length = (content.match(/\n/g)||[]).length + content.length

            if (content == '') {
                $('#twitter-footer').hide()
            } else {
                $('#twitter-footer').show().html(content)
            }

            if (content_length > 1000) {
                $('#twitter-counter').removeClass('text-success').addClass('text-danger').html(content_length-1000+' character surplus.')
            } else {
                $('#twitter-counter').removeClass('text-danger').addClass('text-success').html(1000-content_length+' character left.')
            }
        }
    })
