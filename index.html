# About Me

My name is Alexandre Laplante, I am a software developer living in Ottawa. I have a Master's degree in Computer Science with specialization in Quantum Information from the university of Waterloo. I also have a bachelor's degree in Computer Science with a Minor in Physics from the University of Ottawa.

My Master's Thesis presented an efficient parallel algorithm for solving a certain class of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semidefinite_programming">Semidefinite Programs</a>, thus showing the containment of a quantum complexity class called <a href="https://complexityzoo.uwaterloo.ca/Complexity_Zoo:X#xormipstar21">XOR-MIP*[2,1]</a> in <a href="https://complexityzoo.uwaterloo.ca/Complexity_Zoo:P#pspace">PSPACE</a>. The paper is available <a href="/stuff/research_paper.pdf">here</a>.
