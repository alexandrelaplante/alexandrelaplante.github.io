## About Me

<img src="/stuff/photo.png" title="My ugly mug and my pacman mug." class="img-circle img-responsive" style="float:right; width:200px; margin:20px">

My name is Alexandre Laplante, I am a software engineer living in Mountain View, California. I have a Master's degree in Computer Science with specialization in Quantum Information from the University of Waterloo. I studied at the Institute for Quantum Computing (IQC) under my supervisor <a href="http://www.math.uwaterloo.ca/~anayak/">Prof. Ashwin Nayak</a>. I also have a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science with a Minor in Physics from the University of Ottawa.

My Master's thesis presented an efficient parallel algorithm for approximating the solution to a certain class of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semidefinite_programming">Semidefinite Programs</a>, thus showing the containment of a quantum complexity class called <a href="https://complexityzoo.uwaterloo.ca/Complexity_Zoo:X#xormipstar21">âŠ•MIP*[2,1]</a> in <a href="https://complexityzoo.uwaterloo.ca/Complexity_Zoo:P#pspace">PSPACE</a>. The paper is available <a href="/stuff/research_paper.pdf">here</a>.

I went on to co-found <a href="http://listur.co">listur.co</a>, writing 35 of the initial articles. The back-end is written in perl and features a robust custom editing and administration system, as well as a full suite of unit and selenium tests.

I then co-founded <a href="http://www.ookra.com">ookra.com</a>, a photography management system. Ookra lets photographers keep track of customer information through an app, and lets photographers upload all of their images at once to the Ookra site. The site then combines the information from the app with the timestamps of the uploaded pictures to contact all the customers with a page to buy their photographs.

I currently work at <a href="http://esharesinc.com">eShares</a> as a software engineer. eShares is an SEC-registered Transfer Agent for private companies. It is used to legally issue electronic shares, options, and notes, and manage a real-time cap table.
