## About Me

<img src="/stuff/Screenshot-50.png" class="img-circle img-responsive" style="float:right; width:200px; margin:20px">

My name is Alexandre Laplante, I am a software engineer living in Mountain View, California. I have a Master's degree in Computer Science with specialization in Quantum Information from the University of Waterloo. I studied at the Institute for Quantum Computing (IQC) under my supervisor <a href="http://www.math.uwaterloo.ca/~anayak/">Prof. Ashwin Nayak</a>. I also have a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science with a Minor in Physics from the University of Ottawa.

My Master's thesis presented an efficient parallel algorithm for approximating the solution to a certain class of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semidefinite_programming">Semidefinite Programs</a>, thus showing the containment of a quantum complexity class called <a href="https://complexityzoo.uwaterloo.ca/Complexity_Zoo:X#xormipstar21">âŠ•MIP*[2,1]</a> in <a href="https://complexityzoo.uwaterloo.ca/Complexity_Zoo:P#pspace">PSPACE</a>. The paper is available <a href="/stuff/research_paper.pdf">here</a>.

I currently work at <a href="http://esharesinc.com">eShares</a> as an engineering lead.
